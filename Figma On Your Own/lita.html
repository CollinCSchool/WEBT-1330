                <p>Hello and welcome to Lita's podcast I’m your host Angelita Paul and here we talk about the wacky world of the internet. So, Today we are talking about Mr. Nicholas Perry Known as Nikocado Avocado and his extreme weight-loss of 250 pounds. Let's talk about Nikocado Avocado from the start. Mr. Perry was a freelance violinist and worked at Home Depot back in 2011-2012, 2013 he moved to New York to pursue his dream to be in a Broadway orchestra, but then to early 2014 he decides to leave his musical career to settle down with Oralin Home and which is where he starts his YouTube channel of him vloging his vegan lifestyle. 2016 he came out with him not wanting to be a vegan anymore then following a year later he got married to Oralin which from there he continued to post him doing Mukbangs eating a big load of food with Oralin home. Nikocado Avocado would be nothing without social media, social media gives him the power to put himself out there which means anyone on any platform can see him. To Nikocado, any engagement is good engagement. He takes the negative comments and adapts to be more dislikeable. Nikocado is not afraid of the hate and turns it around on the viewers by playing an extremely exaggerated character of himself to be more dislikeable. Nikocado uses social media manipulation by rage baiting hate comments. His shock factor alone will get people to comment and share his videos to their friends. Nikocado fully understands how to engineer his viewers into working in his favor. He understands that the algorithm is based on interaction and by playing a character where everything except his physical appearance is faked he can get exactly what he wants; fame, or rather infamy. Nikocado's shock factor includes his severe obesity, the amount of food he consumes in a single sitting, and his personality. He is dramatic, he treats his partner terribly, and he is objectively gross. He started humbly as a vegan youtuber and then it spiraled into him becoming the opposite, which led exactly to the fame that he wanted. Nikocado is obviously very unhealthy. His mental health is hard to figure out because of how dramatic he is in front of a camera. It is hard to say what is real and what is not. However, it is very easy to see that physically, he is, or at least was, very overweight. Being that large is tough on the human body and is why it is called "morbidly obese". You either lose the weight or die eventually from health complications related to being overweight. Most of his audience genuinely finds his content entertaining but would never want to look like him. Not many people could ever eat as much as he can in a single sitting. Unfortunately for some who struggle with being overweight, they may get compared to Nikocado. This can cause those people to become upset and lead to bad mental health. Nikocado is not solely responsible for his audience's treatment of others but he does not make an attempt to foster a good audience, instead choosing to post his hate comments for content. Alright guys, that's all for today's podcast! We learned that social media can cause people to have irrational opinions based on misinformation or lack of critical thinking. Nikocado is aware of this and uses it against his audience to gain more popularity and influence. He takes little action to prevent harassment, rather, he encourages it, which can trickle down to other people who struggle with obesity. As he explains in his "2 Steps Ahead" video, he is well aware of the lack of critical thinking skills among the audience and shows the absurdity of caring so much about whether he has lost the weight or not. Otherwise, the joke's on you.
